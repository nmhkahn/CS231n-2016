# CS231n 2016 assginment implementation
See more information in [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)

I didn't fully implement assignment1 (knn, image feature) so i don't upload assignment1.<br>
And no answers in inline questions too. :(

## Note
**Currently working assginment3**

## Notice in assignment2
`cnn.py` and `cnn_ap.py` files are for test convolution in locally.<br>
`cnn.py, classifier/conv.py` is [conv-relu-conv-relu]-pool-fc1-fc2-softmax architecture, and `cnn_ap.py, classifier/conv_ap.py` use average pooling technique instead of fc1 layer in `conv.py`

And use xavier init instead of gaussian normalization in all files.<br>

But there are no correct answers, maybe xavier init and average pooling are wrong. If you find something wrong in my assginment, please tell me something.
